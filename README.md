# Active Contour and Canny Edge Detection Visualization

Welcome to the Active Contour and Canny Edge Detection Visualization project! This project combines the implementation of active contour (snakes) and Canny edge detection algorithms, visualized within a PyQt5 application.

## Overview

The active contour algorithm, also known as snakes, is implemented from scratch within this project. It's applied to a given image based on a certain shape, allowing for segmentation and object tracking tasks. Additionally, the project integrates the Canny edge detection algorithm to enhance the contour detection process.

## Features

- Implementation of active contour (snakes) and Canny edge detection algorithms
- Visualization within a PyQt5 application GUI
- Customizable parameters for active contour:
  - Alpha, beta, and gamma values
  - Number of iterations
  - Shape selection: ellipse or square contour
- Real-time visualization of contour evolution
- Error handling for invalid input

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the application using Python.

## Dependencies

  The project requires the following dependencies:
  
  - PyQt5
  - OpenCV
  - NumPy
  
  Install them using the following command:
  
  ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
